# Polynomial Regression

Python package that analyses the given datasets and comes up with the best polynomial regression representation with the smallest polynomial degree possible, to be the most reliable with the least complexity possible

In order to use the script properly change the x and y values on the top of the page to the two datasets you want to represent mathematically, then run the code, it will print the R² value, the equation and its degree, besides displaying the chart with the regression
