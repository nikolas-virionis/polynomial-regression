## Setup 

### Requirements:
  - Python installed<br>
 The ideal version, to run the package is 3.9.x, the version in which the package was built over,<br> however,
 older versions of python 3 shouldn't have any issues, as the package does not use any <br> 
 fancy, new methods, not supported by older versions of Python 3.x
 
  - Installing the package<br>

For Microsoft Windows
~~~powershell
pip install polynomial-regression-model
~~~
For Linux
~~~bash
pip3 install polynomial-regression-model
~~~
  - Importing the package<br>

Firstly, it's necessary to import the method regress from the package polinomial_regression.main. It will analyse the parameter(s) and return the right object with all the methods it provides:
 ~~~ python
 from polinomial_regression.main import regress
 ~~~
 
 Then, there are two ways of using this model: One which provides both the axis values, x and y, and the math is done, and the other which provides only the y axis, would be more fitting to a use case of overtime monitoring of a single metric, sleect the best option to use below:

 First the one that relates two different metrics, it is necessary to pass two same sized lists of numbers
 ~~~ python
 regression = regress([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
 ~~~

 And also the one that monitors the overtime behaviour of a single metric, it is necessary to pass a number list
 ~~~ python
 regression = regress([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
 ~~~

 
 After we already got our object instance, all there is left to do is enjoy the beauty of math
## Methods
 - get_degree
~~~python
regression.get_degree()
# returns the polynomial degree(index) of the best fitting function
# E.g. 4 in the case of the equation being a 4th degree polynomial
~~~
 - get_ordinal
~~~python
regression.get_ordinal()
# returns the polynomial degree ordinal suffix (for mere better display)
# E.g. th in the case of the equation being a 4"th" degree polynomial
~~~
 - get_full_degree
~~~python
regression.get_full_degree()
# returns the polynomial degree(index) of the best fitting function 
# with its ordinal suffix
# E.g. 4th in the case of the equation being a "4th" degree polynomial
~~~
 - get_coefficients
~~~python
regression.get_coefficients()
# returns a list of all the coefficients of the polynomial equation
# E.g. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] in case of the equation being 
# y = 2x^4 + 3x³ + 4x² + 5x + 6
~~~
 - get_r2
~~~python
regression.get_r2()
# returns the coefficient of determination(R²) to find
# the accuracy of the best fitting regression just calculated
# E.g. 0.9 in the case of the equation being highly accurate]
# in relation to the test data
# I.e. although the perfect index would be 1, in real life data
# that is highly unlikely to happen
~~~
 - get_prediction
~~~python
regression.get_prediction(x: float)
# returns the prediction of the y value correspondent to 
# the x value informed according to the regression calculated
# E.g. 794 in the case of the equation being y = 2x^4 + 3x³ + 4x² + 5x + 6 
# (like the example above)
~~~
 - equation_string
~~~python
regression.equation_string()
# returns the polynomial equation calculated as a string 
# to be better displayed if necessary
# E.g. y = 2x^4 + 3x³ + 4x² + 5x + 6 in the case of the example above
~~~
 - visualization
~~~python
regression.visualization()
# returns the a graphic plot of both a scatter plot of the 
# real data and a line representing the regression calculated
~~~
 - best_degree_polynomial
~~~python
regression.best_degree_polynomial()
# returns the degree of the best fitting polynomial
# inside a string to be displayed
~~~
 - coefficient_of_determination
~~~python
regression.coefficient_of_determination()
# returns the coefficient of determination(R²) of the best 
# fitting polynomial inside a string to be displayed
~~~
 - equation_text
~~~python
regression.equation_text()
# returns the best fitting polynomial inside a string 
# to be displayed
~~~
 - get_prediction
~~~python
regression.get_prediction()
# returns the prediction of the y value correspondent to 
# the x value informed according to the regression calculated
# E.g. 794 in the case of the equation being y = 2x^4 + 3x³ + 4x² + 5x + 6 
# (like the example above)
~~~
 - full_text_analysis
~~~python
regression.full_text_analysis()
# returns the combination of the previous analysis, building 
# the full analysis as a text
~~~~~~
 - full_analysis
~~~python
regression.full_analysis()
# returns the full text analysis after plotting the
# visualization plots
~~~
 - print_full_analysis
~~~python
regression.print_full_analysis()
# prints the full text analysis and plots the
# visualization charts
~~~
